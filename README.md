#### [illDance](https://github.com/lilsmokie/AE-scripts/tree/main/IllDance_v0.5)

Waay back before Overlord by Battle Axe I was trying to hammer out an Illustrator to AE workflow.

1. Install these in both AE and Illustrator
2. Open the programs and enjoy
3. New material is created with your multishader

#### [Object Line Beamer](https://github.com/lilsmokie/AE-scripts/blob/main/ObjectLineBeamer_v004.jsx)

  Select a few nulls and this script will connect them with a Beam effect in a line. 
  This might be better done with a shape layer now.

1. Select your nulls
2. Run script
3. Adjust sliders for thickness, color and softness
4. The time slider runs a line through all the nulls as if they were one
