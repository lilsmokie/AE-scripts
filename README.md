#### [AI_Layover](https://github.com/lilsmokie/AE_scripts_and_rigs/tree/main/AI_Layover_v0.5)

Waay back before Overlord by Battle Axe I was trying to hammer out an Illustrator to AE workflow.

1. Open AE and Illustrator
2. Assign each script to a hot key in their respective program
3. Enjoy

#### [Object Line Beamer](https://github.com/lilsmokie/AE-scripts/blob/main/ObjectLineBeamer_v004.jsx)

  Select a few nulls and this script will connect them with a Beam effect in a line. 
  This might be better done with a shape layer now.

1. Select your nulls
2. Run script
3. Adjust sliders for thickness, color and softness
4. The time slider runs a line through all the nulls as if they were one

#### [LevelBezierClones](https://github.com/lilsmokie/AE_scripts_and_rigs/tree/main/LevelBezierClones_v006)
  
  Simple expression that calculates a curve using nulls as the start and stop. Distributes layers based on a slider.
